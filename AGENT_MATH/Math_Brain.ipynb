            "**Example:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's say we have a torus with r = 5 cm and R = 10 cm. The volume would be:\n",
            "\n",
            "V = 2π²(10 cm)(5 cm)²\n",
            "V = 2 * (3.14159)² * 10 cm * 25 cm²\n",
            "V ≈ 2 * 9.8696 * 250 cm³\n",
            "V ≈ 4934.8 cm³\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, the volume of this torus is approximately 4934.8 cubic centimeters. Always include units in your final answer.\n",

            "**Changes Made and Justifications:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Enhanced Explanation of r and R:** The descriptions are more intuitive, using the \"donut\" analogy and relating the radii to specific parts of the shape. I also added the phrase \"minor radius\" and \"major radius\" to help students with terminology.\n",
            "*   **Formula Presentation:**  I presented the formula in two equivalent forms. The first form, `V = (2πR)(πr²)`, highlights the connection to Pappus's centroid theorem, which provides a deeper understanding of the formula's origin. The second form, `V = 2π²Rr²`, is the more common and compact representation.\n",
            "*   **Emphasis on Units:** Reinforced the importance of consistent units and including units in the final answer.\n",
            "*   **Slightly More Precise Language:** Replaced \"step-by-step explanation\" with \"breakdown\" for a less rigid feel.\n",
            "*   **Mention of Pappus's Centroid Theorem:** Briefly mentioned the theorem to provide context for students who might be interested in the derivation.\n",
            "*   **Calculator Use:** Suggested using the π button on a calculator for better accuracy.\n"
